      <h1>Jess's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>If you're here, you probably already know that I'm a <strong>Google STEP intern</strong>. However, I'm also frequently described as an <strong>Incoming Sophomore at UT Austin</strong>, a <strong>CS and Math Double Major</strong>, a <strong>fraternal twin</strong>, an <strong>amateur unicyclist</strong>, and a <strong>tennis enthusiast</strong>. When I work, I describe myself as a <strong>curious developer</strong>. In the future, I hope to become a <strong>decent ukulelist</strong>, a <strong>strong writer</strong>, and eventually, a <strong>full-time software developer</strong>.
